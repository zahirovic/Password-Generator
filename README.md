# Password Generator

## Description

I created a web application to generate a secure password using starter code. This helped me practice core concepts of JavaScript.  

## Installation

N/A

## Usage 

To use the web application simply hit generate, enter the length of characters needed, click okay to the criteria you would like included/cancel to criteria you would like excluded, and the random password should appear.

This website was created to practice the following skills:
- Javascript
- Deployment to GitHub Pages
- Using Markdown to write a README

#### The work done can be found the GitHub repository [zahirovic/Password-Generator](https://github.com/zahirovic/Password-Generator)
- The actual product can be found **[here](https://zahirovic.github.io/Password-Generator/)** and should look along the lines of this depending on device screen size:
